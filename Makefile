# flux-containers — supply-chain pipeline for the patchy platform: vendors
# pinned upstream helm charts, discovers and digest-pins their images, verifies
# upstream provenance, scans everything, and publishes charts + images to the
# platform Artifact Registry with keyless cosign signatures.
#
# Everything lives in mise tasks: the shared toolchain submodule at .mise/
# provides the pinned tools + universal lint tasks, and tasks.toml carries the
# pipeline surface. This Makefile is only the thin forwarding shim —
# `make <task> CHART=<name>` == `CHART=<name> mise run <task>`.
